AquaSense is an enterprise-grade IoT smart agriculture platform engineered for precision **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD)** water management in rice paddies. The platform integrates long-range LoRaWAN telemetry nodes, edge node autonomous decision-making engines, real-time WebSocket event streams, field-scoped security controls, and centralized irrigation management to optimize agricultural yield while reducing water consumption by up to 30%.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Architectural Paradigms**:
> 1. **Node Autonomous Decision Making**: Irrigation needs are calculated automatically based on continuous water-level readings captured by sensor nodes deployed across monitoring zones.
> 2. **Centralized Field Irrigation**: Individual monitoring zones function strictly as telemetry acquisition points. Pumping actuation is controlled centrally at the field level.
> 3. **Emergency Resort & Manual Fallback**: Manual and centralized pump overrides are reserved strictly for emergency intervention, system testing, or manual override within the dedicated Manual tab.

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose
Conventional flooded rice cultivation requires immense water volumes and contributes significantly to agricultural methane emissions. **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD)** is a proven water-management technique where rice fields are periodically flooded and allowed to dry naturally until soil water levels decline to a critical depth (typically $-15\text{ cm}$) before reflooding. 

AquaSense automates and digitizes the AWD protocol by collecting real-time water depth and soil conditions from multi-node telemetry networks, executing field-level AWD rule evaluations, and driving autonomous or operator-approved irrigation actuation.

### Core Objectives
- **Dynamic Field Topology**: Support arbitrary numbers of monitoring zones ($1\dots N$) per field without legacy fixed quadrant assumptions.
- **Autonomous Decision Engine**: Process telemetry streams to generate real-time reflood recommendations based on active field thresholds.
- **Centralized Actuation & Safety Guardrails**: Execute field-level pump control with safety lockouts, fault detection, and manual emergency fallbacks.
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Provide reactive mobile (Android) and Web interfaces for field operators, agronomists, and system administrators.
- **Auditability**: Capture server-side, immutable audit logs for all security, telemetry, and irrigation events.

## 2. System Architecture

AquaSense follows a decoupled, event-driven IoT architecture spanning physical field sensors, gateway network servers, backend microservices, and client applications.

```

### Data Flow Overview
1. **Telemetry Acquisition**: Sensor nodes measure hydrostatic pressure (water level) and soil parameters, transmitting packed binary payloads via LoRaWAN uplinks.
2. **Ingestion & Processing**: The LoRaWAN Network Server routes payloads to backend API ingestion endpoints, which decode, validate, and store raw telemetry measurements.
3. **Analytics & Evaluation**: The AWD Rule Engine aggregates active zone measurements, evaluates field thresholds, updates field status, and publishes real-time WebSocket state packages.
4. **Actuation Command**: Upon autonomous trigger or authorized emergency override, control signals are routed to the central field pump controller.

---

## 3. Monitoring Architecture

### Dynamic Zone Mapping
Monitoring zones are dynamically allocated per field and are **not hardcoded**. A field may contain $1$ to $N$ monitoring zones depending on paddy dimensions, topography, and elevation variations.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Field {
        +String id
        +String name
        +String location
        +String activeThresholdId
    }

    class MonitoringZone {
        +String id
        +String fieldId
        +String zoneName
        +String nodeAssignmentId
    }

    class SensorNode {
        +String id
        +String hardwareEui
        +NodeStatus status
        +DateTime installedAt
    }

    class Measurement {
        +String id
        +String nodeId
        +double waterLevelCm
        +double soilMoisture
        +DateTime timestamp
    }

    Field "1" *-- "1..*" MonitoringZone : contains
    MonitoringZone "1" o-- "0..1" SensorNode : assigned
    SensorNode "1" *-- "0..*" Measurement : generates
```

### Entity Hierarchy
- **Field**: Top-level agricultural unit governed by a central irrigation system.
- **Monitoring Zone**: Sub-region of a field designated for localized environmental observation.
- **Sensor Node**: Physical IoT device hardware with a unique Device EUI. Nodes can be registered, reassigned, replaced, or decommissioned.
- **Sensor**: Physical transducer (e.g., pressure sensor, soil moisture probe) attached to a node.
- **Measurement**: Immutable point-in-time sensor reading linked to the generating node and zone. Historical records persist across device reassignments.

---

## 4. Irrigation Architecture

### Autonomous Node-Driven Irrigation vs. Centralized Actuation
1. **Observation**: Monitoring nodes capture water depth across field micro-topographies.
2. **Decision Generation**: The AWD decision engine computes aggregated field water levels. If water levels reach the critical AWD threshold (e.g., $-15\text{ cm}$), a reflood requirement is triggered automatically.
3. **Centralized Actuation**: Irrigation pumps are deployed at the field level. Individual monitoring zones do **not** independently control separate pumps.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle : System Initialized
    Idle --> AutonomousEvaluating : Telemetry Received
    
    state AutonomousEvaluating {
        [*] --> CheckWaterLevel
        CheckWaterLevel --> TargetReached : Water Level <= -15cm
        CheckWaterLevel --> SafeRange : Water Level > -15cm
    }

    TargetReached --> AutoIrrigating : Trigger Central Pump
    SafeRange --> Idle : Maintain Monitoring

    AutoIrrigating --> Idle : Water Level >= Target (+5cm)

    state EmergencyManual {
        [*] --> OperatorRequest
        OperatorRequest --> AuthCheck
        AuthCheck --> ManualIrrigating : Verified
        AuthCheck --> AccessDenied : Rejected
    }

    Idle --> EmergencyManual : Operator Override (Manual Tab)
    ManualIrrigating --> Idle : Manual Stop / Timeout
```

### Emergency & Manual Overrides
- **Primary Mode**: Autonomous node-driven irrigation based on field AWD thresholds.
- **Emergency Resort**: Manual pump controls are available under the **Manual Control** tab for emergency water delivery, system priming, or hardware testing.
- **Safety Boundaries**: Manual actuation requires field-scoped `OPERATOR` or `ADMIN` privileges and strictly respects safety lockouts (e.g., thermal pump fault, low-voltage lockout).

---

## 5. Authentication & Authorization

### Field-Scoped Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
User permissions are strictly scoped to specific field instances. Access credentials granted for Field A do not confer operational privileges for Field B.

| Role | Telemetry Viewing | Threshold Config | Manual Override | Node Provisioning | Audit History |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **VIEWER** | Read-Only | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Read-Only |
| **OPERATOR** | Read-Only | Read-Only | ✅ | ❌ | Read-Only |
| **AGRONOMIST** | Read-Only | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Read-Only |
| **FIELD_ADMIN** | Full Access | Full Access | Full Access | ✅ | Full Access |

### Authentication & Session Management
- **Token Model**: Short-lived JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for API requests paired with secure refresh token rotation.
- **Secure Storage**: Mobile credentials are stored in encrypted hardware keystores (Flutter Secure Storage / Android KeyStore).
- **Session Lifecycles**: Automatic session invalidation upon privilege revocation or timeout.

---

## 6. Audit Logging

AquaSense logs all critical system operations server-side to maintain an unalterable record for compliance, safety verification, and operational diagnosis.

### Audit Log Entity Schema
```json
{
  "id": "audit_8f92a10b",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-25T14:32:00.000Z",
  "actor": {
    "type": "HUMAN",
    "id": "usr_4412",
    "role": "FIELD_ADMIN"
  },
  "action": "IRRIGATION_MANUAL_OVERRIDE_START",
  "target": {
    "type": "FIELD_PUMP",
    "id": "pump_field_01"
  },
  "result": "SUCCESS",
  "metadata": {
    "durationMinutes": 30,
    "reason": "Emergency reflood test",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.1.45"
  }
}
```

### Tracked Actions
- **Security**: Authentication successes/failures, password updates, role reassignments.
- **Device Management**: Node registration, hardware replacement, calibration parameter edits.
- **Control Actuation**: Autonomous irrigation starts/stops, manual emergency overrides, emergency abort triggers.
- **Configuration**: AWD threshold modifications, safety timeout adjustments.

---

## 7. IoT / LoRaWAN Architecture

### Telemetry Pipeline
1. **Sensors**: Submersible hydrostatic pressure transducers and capacitive soil moisture probes.
2. **Node Hardware**: Ultra-low-power LoRaWAN Class A / Class C end-nodes.
3. **Gateway Protocol**: Packet forwarder over Semtech UDP or Semtech Basics Station protocol.
4. **Network Server**: ChirpStack / TTN routing payloads via HTTP Webhooks or MQTT to backend ingestion services.

```
[ Sensor Node ] --(LoRaWAN 868/915 MHz)--> [ LoRaWAN Gateway ] --(MQTT/HTTPS)--> [ AquaSense Ingestion API ]
```

### Provisioning & Device Health
- **Provisioning**: OTAA (Over-The-Air Activation) using unique DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey combinations.
- **Device Telemetry**: Every uplink payload contains battery voltage ($V$), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and sensor status flags.
- **Health Monitoring**: Nodes missing scheduled uplink windows transition to `STALE` and eventually `OFFLINE` status.

---

## 8. AWD Analysis & Decision Engine

### Threshold & Decision Principles
The AWD Decision Engine evaluates field water levels continuously using configured depth boundaries:

$$\text{Field Effective Level } (h_{\text{field}}) = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} h_{i}$$

Where $M$ is the count of active, non-stale monitoring nodes.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------+  +20 cm (Overflow Limit)
|                      Paddy Surface                        |  0 cm
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|               Safe Drying Zone (AWD Range)                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+  -15 cm (Critical AWD Threshold -> REFLOOD)
|                 Root Stress Boundary                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Telemetry Edge Case Handling
- **Unequal Water Distribution**: If elevation differences cause uneven drying, the engine highlights maximum drying zones to prevent crop distress.
- **Missing / Stale Data**: Nodes that drop offline are excluded from field averages. If active node coverage falls below $50\%$, the system flags a `TELEMETRY_DEGRADED` alert and prohibits autonomous pump start.
- **Observation vs. Actuation**: Monitoring zones observe conditions; the AWD engine evaluates rules; the field pump executes actuation.

3. **Phase 3 (Planned)**: AI-driven predictive water drying rate forecasting using local weather telemetry integration.

---

## 20. Contribution & Development Guidelines

1. **Branching Strategy**: Create feature branches off `main` using `feature/feature-name` or `fix/fix-name`.
2. **Commit Standards**: Write concise, descriptive commit messages adhering to Conventional Commits.
3. **Quality Gates**: Ensure `dart analyze` passes with zero warnings and all `flutter test` cases execute cleanly before filing pull requests.

---

## 21. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`RenderFlex overflowed`** | Unbounded column/row in narrow mobile viewport | Ensure text or action buttons are wrapped in `Expanded` or `Wrap`. |
| **`Telemetry Stale Warning`** | Mock timer or socket connection lost | Check server URL or restart mock stream in settings. |
| **`Build error on flutter pub get`** | Package version mismatch | Run `flutter clean` followed by `flutter pub get`. |
